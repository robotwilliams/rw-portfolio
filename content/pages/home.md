## Recent Work

Things I have worked on...

## Skills

My areas of focus...

### 1. Perspective

My past experiences have given me the ability to deliver a final execution that is intuitive and natural to the end user. I am able to work independently or with a small to large sized team.

### 2. Future-Proofing

With so much of today's media being viewed beyond standard device size, it is crucial to design for media that literally cannot not be seen, but is always being experienced.

### 3. Process-Oriented

Interaction design is a complex mix of UX, UI, IA and unique use cases. Every new client project is a collection problems just waiting to be solved!

### 4. Results-Focused

I love to jump into a new system and improve it. Contact me for refactoring projects and CMS Maintenance.

### The Color Green

**April 25, 2019**

Outside of material possessions, I look at colors in very different way by themselves. Each colors brings with it a feeling and a purpose in my opinion. This is what brings me to why green is my favorite color. I find it to be an intelligent color, but also wise and infinite.

### Web Typography

**March 27, 2019**

The point of choosing a strong font combination is to communicate your message efficiently through a visual hierarchy. While working towards a strong visual impact, there more nuanced reasons as to why you should choose a strong font choice early in the web design & development process.
