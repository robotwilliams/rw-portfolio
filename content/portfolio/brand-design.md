# Edgewater Landscapes LLC

A comprehensive website redesign for Edgewater Landscapes LLC, a premier landscape design and development company serving the greater Philadelphia area.

## Project Overview

Edgewater Landscapes needed a modern, professional website that would showcase their portfolio of landscape projects and make it easy for potential clients to get in touch. The site needed to be both visually stunning and highly functional.
