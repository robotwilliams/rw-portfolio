## Recent Work

Things I have worked on...

## Skills

My areas of focus...

### 1. Perspective

My past experiences have given me the ability to deliver a final execution that is intuitive and natural to the end user.

### 2. Future-Proofing

With so much of today's media being viewed beyond standard device size, it is crucial to design for media that literally cannot not be seen, but is always being experienced.

### 3. Process-Oriented

Interaction design is a complex mix of UX, UI, IA and unique use cases. Every new client project is a collection problems just waiting to be solved!

### 4. Results-Focused

I love to jump into a new system and improve it. Contact me for refactoring projects and CMS Maintenance.
